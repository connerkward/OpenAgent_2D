Some Notes

Passing locations (and "transforms" I suppose we could call them)
might be better in long term sent as an array of 2 ints
can discuss the cost benefit of using two integers instead

Board needs constructor updated as a vector matrix

Passing around references to the board
//(pointer conversion depends on if null state needed)
