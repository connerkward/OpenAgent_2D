Some Notes To Self

DONT CHANGE ANY HEADER FILES
DEAR GOD

FOR ALL THAT IS HOLY







Everything that is printed to the board an Entity

That means Tiles, Obstacles, Agents, Foods, everything else derived from the superclass Entity

Also notice that theres some wacked up sizeX and sizeY situations in certain for loops.
It works, but it aint pretty.


Any functions commented out might be useful and should be completed or left till nessesary

The reason that we gotta send coordinates around as arrays instead of two values is there is no reasona and its entirely more verbose for no real benefit
